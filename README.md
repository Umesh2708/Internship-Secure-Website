# Secure Cloud-Hosted Web Application on AWS

## 📌 Project Level
Intermediate / Internship-Level Project

---

## 📖 Project Description
This project demonstrates the deployment of a secure cloud-hosted web application using Amazon Web Services (AWS).  
A simple web application was developed and hosted on an AWS EC2 Free Tier instance, following cloud security best practices.  
The project focuses on secure access, proper resource management, and cost optimization.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand cloud-based web application deployment
- To host a web application using AWS EC2
- To configure security using IAM and Security Groups
- To follow AWS Free Tier usage and avoid billing
- To document the deployment using GitHub

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Services Used
- AWS EC2 (Free Tier)
- AWS IAM
- AWS Security Groups
- Apache Web Server
- HTML
- Git & GitHub

## 🧩 Project Architecture
User → Internet → Security Group (Firewall) → EC2 Instance → Web Application

---

## 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. Created an AWS IAM user for secure access
2. Launched a Free Tier EC2 instance
3. Configured Security Groups to allow HTTP and restricted SSH access
4. Installed and configured Apache web server
5. Deployed a simple HTML web application
6. Verified application accessibility using public IP
7. Captured screenshots for documentation
8. Terminated all AWS resources to avoid billing

## 🔐 Security Features
- IAM user used instead of root account
- SSH access restricted to specific IP
- Only required ports (22, 80) opened
- Basic monitoring enabled

---

## 💰 Cost Management
- AWS Free Tier services only
- Resources deleted after testing
- AWS budget alert configured
- No billing generated
